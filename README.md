Brick-A-Bloom: Sales Trends and Customer Insights Analysis
Project Background
Brick-A-Bloom, a small business specializing in LEGO flower bouquets, sought to scale its operations and improve its sales strategy. Despite its creative product line, the business faced challenges with seasonal sales fluctuations and inconsistent customer demand for wrapper and ribbon colors.
The key question was: How can we leverage data to optimize sales performance and better align with customer preferences?

Challenge
The business owner observed a significant spike in sales during the holiday season (November and December) . Additionally, the wide range of customization options for wrappers and ribbons led to inventory inefficiencies, as some colors were consistently underutilized.
The main objectives were:
1.	Identify which products and customization options drove the most revenue.
2.	Uncover actionable seasonal trends.
3.	Optimize inventory and marketing strategies to boost profitability and minimize costs.

Approach
I approached the problem systematically, leveraging data analysis and visualization to uncover actionable insights:
1.	Data Preparation:
o	Consolidated historical sales data, including order details, product types, customer preferences, and revenue metrics.
o	Cleaned the data for consistency, ensuring accurate analysis of trends and patterns.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Conducted EDA using Excel to uncover key trends in seasonal sales, product popularity, and customer preferences.
o	Segmented data by month, product type, wrapper, and ribbon preferences.
3.	Visualization and Dashboard Creation:
o	Built an interactive sales dashboard with key metrics like total sales by month, wrapper and ribbon popularity, and revenue by product type.
o	Created the following visuals to tell the story: 
	Line Chart: Displaying total sales over time, clearly showing spikes in November and December and a sharp drop in January.
	Bar Chart: Highlighting the popularity of wrapper colors, where Milktea accounted for 25% of total orders, far surpassing others.
	Stacked Bar Chart: Showing ribbon color preferences by product type, with Champagne and White dominating across all products.
	Pie Chart: Breaking down product types (1-piece, 2-piece, 3-piece bouquets) and their contributions to revenue.
4.	Strategic Recommendations:
o	Formulated actionable strategies based on insights to address seasonal trends, inventory inefficiencies, and customer behavior.
